Quote a Day App

STORY 2-1:
I would like to see a quote displayed on the homepage.

- generate the app
- add a quotes controller with an index view
    script/generate controller quotes index
- hard code a quote in the index view
- you should be able to see it at http://localhost:3000/quotes
- add a route to config/routes.rb
    map.root :controller => 'quotes'


STORY 2-2:
I would like to see this quote on the cloud.  Deploy it to Heroku

- create a git repo
  - git init
  - git add .
  - git commit -m "initial checkin"
- create a heroku project
  - go to http://heroku.com/ and sign up for an account
  - sudo gem install heroku
  - heroku create <yourname>-quotes
    - you'll have to enter your heroku credentials
- push to heroku
  - git push heroku master
- you should see it now at : <yourname>-quotes.heroku.com


STORY 2-3:
I would like to be able to add more quotes, and display the last one added.

- generate a quote model
  - script/generate model quote content:text author:string
- migrate the db
- add a resource route
    map.resources :quotes
- add a new action / view
- add a create action that redirects to the index_path
- add a link to the new quote page


STORY 2-4:
Deploy that to heroku


STORY 2-5:
Instead of seeing the last quote, show a random quote
