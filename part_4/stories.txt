get the updated music app up and running on your machine from :

  http://github.com/jeremylightsmith/Rails-Class/tree/master/music/

restore the database to a known state with :

  rake db:drop db:migrate db:seed
  
for all of these stories, consider the "artist_page_mockup.jpg" in this directory.



STORY 5-1: 
Show "breadcrumbs" at top left of screen, along with artist name.  Then show big (450px wide) picture of artist on right side of screen.
The screen should be a fixed width, and should use the same layout for the fixed width that the album uses.


STORY 5-2:
Show all the albums associated with the artist below the artist in a black section.  It should have the title albums.  Show 3 across, each with a small (75px wide) image.  They should go 3 across and then wrap.


STORY 5-3:
Paginate the albums associated with the artist.

Install the will_paginate gem, and show me a paginated view.

more information on how to do this is here :

http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate/


STORY 5-4:
Allow the user to sort the albums associated with the artist (by name or release date).  Use a form with a drop down to achieve this.


STORY 5-5:
Write a page that shows all albums.  It should look just like the albums part of the artist page (use a partial to share the code).


STORY 5-6: (slack)
Allow the user to ask for the xml for an artist.  For example, if they asked for :

  http://localhost:3000/artists/1.xml

They might get something like :

  <artist name="Bob Dylan" genre="Rock">
    <album name="Blowin' in the Wind"/>
    <album name="Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"/>
    <album name="The Times, They Are A-Changin'"/>
    <album name="It Ain't Me, Babe"/>
    <album name="Maggie's Farm"/>
    <album name="It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"/>
    <album name="Mr. Tambourine Man"/>
    <album name="Subterranean Homesick Blues"/>
    <album name="Like a Rolling Stone"/>
  </artist>
