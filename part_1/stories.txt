A lot of this comes from http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html feel free to follow along there

STORY 1-1
I would like to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) posts

- generate the app w/ "rails quotes"
- start the server :
    script/server
- remove the /public/index.html
- generate scaffold for posts :
    script/generate scaffold Post name:string title:string content:text
- create database
    rake db:migrate
- look at your application :
    http://localhost:3000/posts


STORY 1-2
I would like to remove the duplication in the views new & edit

- create a partial called app/views/posts/_form.html.erb, and put the common parts of new.html.erb & edit.html.erb there
- replace them with a reference to the "partial"
    <%= render :partial => "form" %>
    

STORY 1-3
I would like to CRUD comments

- generate the scaffold for comments :
    script/generate scaffold Comment name:string content:text post:references
- run migration
    rake db:migrate
- you'll need to remove the post piece on the new & edit views


STORY 1-4
I would like to see the comments associated with a post on the post show page.
- add to Post
    has_many :comments
- make sure Comment has this code
    belongs_to :post
- move the appropriate code from app/views/comments/index.html.erb to app/views/posts/show.html.erb
  - instead of @comments, list @post.comments


Story 1-5
I would like to create a comment attached to the post from the post page

- add the post_id to the new comment link
- in comments_controller/new, build the comment from the post
- remove the "post" part of the new & edit views
  - replace the post lines with a hidden tag
- after saving, it should go back to the post path
  - this should be true for all actions


STORY 1-6
Make it pretty
