Congratulations on registering for the Startup Weekend Rails Bootcamp on Sunday, October 31st.

We said we'd send you some info about what you would need to show up with on the day of the bootcamp.  This is that info.  

You will need :


1) Ruby 1.8.7 & Rails 3.0 installed on your machine.
There are some pretty straightforward instructions and links here : http://rubyonrails.org/download


2) At least a little knowledge of Ruby.  
If you've used Ruby before, you're good here.  If not, please spend 20 minutes, and go through this tutorial : http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/


3) Git installed on your machine.
On OSX, I recommend http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/
On Windows, I recommend http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ and using all their default install options.


Come with all those things, and you should be in good shape.


One last thing, due to space limitations, there were only 12 seats available for this bootcamp.  You got one, so you better come!  In all seriousness, there is a pretty sizable waiting list, so please let us know if you won't be making it and we'll let someone else in.


Thanks, and we're looking forward to having you here!
