Task List App

STORY 3-1
I would like to create a list, see all the current lists, and see one list.

(if you want to cheat, generate a scaffold and delete the extra code)

- create the app
- create a list "resource" (basically a scaffold but empty)
    rails generate resource list
- add a name column to the database migration that was created
    db/migrate
- support actions 
    index
    new
    create
    show
- create views for
    index
    new
    show
- add a root route so http://localhost:3000/ => lists / index
    (config/routes.rb)


STORY 3-2
I would like to see all the tasks for a given list on the show page for that list.  I would also like to add a task to the list on that same page.

- create a task resource 
- add a name & list column to the database migration created
- add create action to the task controller
- add relationships to both the task & list
    class Task
      belongs_to :list
      ...
      
    class List
      has_many :tasks
      ...

- show tasks for a list on the list show view
- add a form to create new tasks on the list show view


STORY 3-3
Deploy to Heroku.


STORY 3-4
I would like to be able to check off a task by clicking the checkbox next to it.

- add a link next to each task with a "[ ]" in it, the link should go to DELETE /tasks/ID
- implement tasks/destroy


STORY 3-5
Deploy to Heroku.

STORY 3-6
I would like all lists to have names and for those names to be unique.

- add validation to the list class
    validates_uniqueness_of :name
    validates_presence_of :name
- in the list controller's create action, check the value returned by save to know if there were any errors
  - if there were no errors, then redirect
  - if there were errors, then show the new page without redirecting
- do the same in the list controller's edit action
- show the errors in the view w/
    <%= error_messages_for :list %>
